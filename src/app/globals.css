  Any global custom base styles can go below if needed. 
  The :root variable theming has been removed to use Tailwind's darkMode: 'class'.
  The Inter font is already handled by next/font/google in layout.tsx and 
  applied to the body via a className, so no explicit body font-family 
  declaration is strictly necessary here for Inter.
